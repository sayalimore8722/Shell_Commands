1. ls - Show lists of files or information on the files
      ls file     # does the file exist?
      ls -l file  # show information about the file
      ls *.txt    # show all files ending in .txt
      ls -lt      # show information about all files in date order
      ls -lrt     # above reversed in order
      ls -a       # show all files including hidden files
      ls dir      # show contents of directory
      ls -d dir   # does the directory exist?
      ls -p       # adds meaning characters to ends of filenames
      ls -R       # show files also in subdirectories of directory
      ls -1       # show one file per line
      ls -s       # print the allocated size of each file, in blocks.
      
2.  cd - Change current directory
      cd                     # go to home directory
      cd ~/papers            # go to /home/user/papers
      cd ~fred               # go to /home/fred
      cd dir                 # go to directory (relative)
      cd /dir1/dir2/dir3...  # go to directory (absolute)
      cd -                   # go to last directory you were in
      cd ..                  # go to one directory level up
      
3.  mkdir - Make new directory
      mkdir dir             # creates new directory with name dir
      mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3  # can simultaneously create multiple directories
      rm test.txt           # removes file test.txt
      rm -r test            # recursively deletes all the directory content
      
4.  cp - copy file
      cp file1 file2                      # copy file1 to file2
      cp file1 directory                  # copy file1 into directory
      cp file1 file2 file3 ... directory  # copy files into directory
      cp -R dir1 dir2/                    # copy dir1 into dir2 including subdirectries
      cp -pR dir1 dir2/                   # copy directory, preserving permissions
  
5.  mv - move file/s  
      mv file1 file2                     # rename file1 to file2
      mv dir1 dir2                       # rename directory dir1 to dir2
      mv file1 file2 file3 ... directory # move files into directory
      
6.  tar - Combine files into one larger archive file, or extract files from that archive (same as gtar on Linux).
      tar cvf /dev/rmt/0 ./      # backup cwd into tape
      tar tvf /dev/rmt/0         # list contents of tape
      tar xvf /dev/rmt/0         # extract contents of tape
      tar zcvf myproject-0.1.tar.gz myproject-0.1
      
7.  top - Interactively show you the ``top'' processes on a system - the ones consuming the most computing (CPU) time. Press the ``q'' key in top to exit.
    Press the ``k'' key to kill a particular process. Press ``r'' to renice a process.
    
8.  ps - List processes on system

9.  pwd - shows present working directory

10. kill - Kill, pause or continue a process. Can also be used for killing daemons.

11. Compress files
    gzip file.fits          # compresses file.fits into file.fits.gz
    gunzip file.fits.gz     # recovers original file.fits
    
12. gtar - GNU version of the tar utility (also called tar on Linux). Store directories and files together into a single archive file.
Use the normal tar program to backup files to a tape. See info tar for documentation.
    gtar cf out.tar dir1    # put contents of directory into out.tar
    gtar czf out.tar.gz dir1 # write compressed tar, out.tar.gz
    gtar tf in.tar          # list contents of in.tar
    gtar tzf in.tar.gz      # list contents of compressed in.tar.gz
    gtar xf in.tar          # extract contents of in.tar here
    gtar xzf in.tar.gz      # extract compressed in.tar.gz
    
15.grep - Look for text in files. List out lines containing text (with filename if more than one file examined).
    grep "hi there" file1 file2 ... # look for 'hi there' in files
    grep -i "hi there" filename     # ignore capitals in search
    cat filename | grep "hi there"  # use pipe
    grep -v "foo" filename          # list lines that do not include foo
